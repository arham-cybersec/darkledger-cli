# darkledger-cli
A terminal-based mock banking system that handles authentication, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction logging. Focused on core Python principles: loops, lists, conditionals, error handling, and data persistence. Contains a hidden ASCII mark at program exit.

💸 DarkLedger CLI

A lightweight command-line banking simulator written in Python.
Built to sharpen fundamentals like loops, conditionals, input handling, state tracking, and CLI UX — with a little personality baked in.

Complete basic banking actions, explore the menu system, and if you finish your session properly… you’ll unlock a hidden ASCII signature at the end 😉.

🎯 Project Purpose

This mini-project was built to practice core Python concepts through something functional instead of a generic calculator or guessing game.

It includes:

Mock credential authentication

Account balance management

Deposits & withdrawals

Transaction history logging

Persistent state during runtime

Fun ASCII reveal on exit

It’s simple — but it’s real logic.

🛠️ Features

✔ Username & password validation
✔ Error loops until correct login
✔ Check current balance
✔ Deposit and withdraw funds
✔ Transaction log (indexed history)
✔ Clean, menu-driven command flow
✔ ASCII signature at program end

🔐 Demo Credentials

These are fake placeholders for testing only.
Not tied to any real accounts.

Username: papasmurf23
Password: smurfettegyat

🧠 Core Concepts Used

while loops

Input validation

Conditional branching

List storage for transaction logs

String formatting

State modification

Minimal CLI user experience

This project intentionally avoids frameworks or libraries — just raw Python fundamentals.

🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

python bank.py


Navigate through the menu and try the features.

To unlock the surprise:
🡆 fully exit the application through Option 5.

🤫 Easter Egg

A unique ASCII signature drops at program exit as a little “calling card.”
It’s only visible if you actually run through the program.

🔮 Possible Future Upgrades (Roadmap)

Planned improvements to evolve the app:

Validate numeric inputs to prevent errors

Prevent overdrafts

Add account interest calculation

Save/load user data in a JSON file

Multi-user login system

Export transaction history

Add PIN retry limits

Encrypt stored credentials (hashing)

Convert to OOP (BankAccount class)

GUI or Web dashboard version

🧩 Why This Project Matters

It may be small — but it demonstrates:

practical application of Python

logical thinking

clean structure

control flow

early security habits

user-focused design

Most beginner projects are toy examples.
This one simulates real-world logic.
